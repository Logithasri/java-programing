**where the focus writing step by step function this made it harder to manage reuse code in large scale 
** java is built around oops which helps in organizing code is using class and object

FUTURE OF OOPS CONCEPT
*structures code into logic unit(class &object)
*it keeps relested data together(encapsulation)
*it makes code modulue ,reusable scalble(inheritance)
*it prevents unauthorized access to te data
*it follows  DRY(dont repeat yourself)

TYPES
object
encapsulation
polymorphism
inheritance
abstraction
class

*CLASS:
class is a userdefined blueprint or prototype from which objects or created it represents the set of properties or  methods are common to all objects of contact
using class you can create multiple objects within the same behaviour instead of writing a code multiple times
                                     EG:
                                      *modifiers= a class can be publicor havedefault access
                                      *class name= should be begin with initial letter capatalize
                                       *body= body should surrounded by braces

*OBJECT:
object is a basic unit of oops the represents entities at difficulty java programming it creates many objects which has you know intract by methods  the objects are what perform your  code 
they are part of visibles to the user represents by attributes of an object it also reflect property of the object 
*state : represents by attributes of an object it also reflect property of the object 
*behaviour : represent by method of a object it also reflect it response of an object to another object 
*identity : it is a unique name given to an object the unables to intract with other object
*method : a method collection of statement a perform some specific task and return the result to the caller
