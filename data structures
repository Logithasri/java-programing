    **CONSTRUCTOR:
    * to initialize the object
    * constructor is invoked at the time of object creation
    * it constructs the value i.e.provide data for the object that is why it is known as constructor

**RULES FOR CREATING JAVA CONSTRUCTOR
* constructor name must be same as its class name
* consttructor must have no explicit return type

  **TYPES OF JAVA CONSTRUCTOR
      * default
      * parameterized 

  \\\\\\\\ default constructor:
      A constructor that have no parameter is known as default copnstructor class bike 
    {
      Bike()
      {
        System.out.println("Bike is created");
      }
      public static void main(string[]args){
        bike b=new bike();
      }
    } O/P: Bike is created

      \\\\\\\\ POLYMORPHISM
      * polymorphism means many forms

      Achieved in two ways
      * copmpile time polymorphism method overloading
      * runtime polymorphism method overriding

      \\\\\\method overriding:
      if subclass has the same method as declared in the parent class it is known as method overriding in java 

      \\\\\ Abstraction:
      it is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user
      abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it

      \\\\\\encapsulation:
      it is a process of wrapping  code and data together into a single unit
      it provide you the control over the data
